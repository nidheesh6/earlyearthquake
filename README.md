## Introduction
The goal of the project is to detect the earthquake in the real-time using the data from the IoT SENSORS and notify the people before the earthquake is felt. The fact which makes this project possible is, the time taken to send, process and distribute the data is less comapared to the time taken by the seismic waves generated by earth quake to reach from one place to other.The notify period can be varied between a few seconds to minutes.
